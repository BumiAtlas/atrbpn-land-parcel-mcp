# ATR/BPN Land Parcel Lookup MCP (Indonesia)

Connect your AI assistant to [BumiAtlas](https://bumiatlas.com) for Indonesian land parcel research through the Model Context Protocol.

This listing is a focused entry point for:

- Land parcels (bidang tanah) from ATR/BPN's public land map (BHUMI)
- Certificate number (nomor hak) and NIB lookup, or every parcel at a coordinate
- Right type (Hak Milik, Hak Guna Bangunan, Hak Guna Usaha, Hak Pakai, Hak Pengelolaan, Wakaf), declared vs mapped area, year, side lengths and boundary
- Overlaps with other parcels, HGU, concessions and conservation areas
- BPN village codes and certificate number decoding

The MCP connection is provided by BumiAtlas. This repository does not run a separate server. For parcels, HGU, mining and zoning in one connection, use [BumiAtlas MCP](https://github.com/BumiAtlas/bumiatlas-mcp).
